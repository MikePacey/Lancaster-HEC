Referencing and Acknowledging the HEC
=====================================

To help make the case for continued funding of
the HEC it's important that research projects and
research outcomes (e.g. papers) that use the HEC 
are *linked* to the HEC facility on the PURE system. 

The `PURE help pages <https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/research/research-services/research-information--systems/pure/guidance-documents/>_ 
contain a helpful `User Guide https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/media/lancaster-university/content-assets/documents/research/research-services/pure-user-guides/LinkingEquipment.pdf>`_ 
explaining how they can be linked.
