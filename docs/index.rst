HEC 3.0 Documentation
=====================

This documentation is a guide to using the HEC 3.0 test bed,
in particular the SLURM jobs scheduler which will replace
the current SGE job scheduler. The structure of this guide
is broadly similar to the current official HEC user guide
so you can easily compare the two.

.. note:: 
   The HEC 3.0 test bed is udner development, so check
   back regularly to see what changes have been made to best practice.
