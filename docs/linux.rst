Learning Linux/Unix
===================

The HEC's operating system is Linux, and so a knowledge of
basic Linux commands is required to make good use of the
cluster. For departments that don't offer their own Linux
training courses, here are some pointers for online learning 
material:

* `Introduction to Linux by Lancaster University's Robin Long <https://robinlong-tutorials-linux.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html>`_

* `Search for Linux books using the Lancaster University Library OneSearch facility <http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/library/>`_

You can also subscribe to the Research Software Network channel on Teams
for details of a number of Research IT training courses.
