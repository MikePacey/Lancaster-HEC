Introduction
============

The High End Computing (HEC) Cluster is a centrally-run service to support
researchers and research students at Lancaster who require high performance and
high throughput computing. This includes computing workloads with requirements
that can't be met by the Interactive Unix Service (IUS), desktop PCs or
Virtual Desktops (mydesktop and mylab).

The service combines what was the previously separately supported services for
local high performance computing (HPC) users and the local Particle Physics
research group (GridPP). The combined facility offers 13,000 cores, 59TB of
aggregate memory, 24 Tesla V100 GPUs, 230TB of GPFS-based filestore for
general use and 10PB of Ceph-based filestore for GridPP data.  

The cluster operating system is Rocky Linux 8, with job submission handled by
the SLURM Workload Manager. The service supports a wide variety of third-party
software including popular research applications, numerical packages, libraries
and C and Fortran compilers.

The HEC is funded through a combination of central funding and contributions
from individual research grants.
