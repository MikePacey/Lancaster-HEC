Introduction
============

The High End Computing (HEC) Cluster is a centrally-run service to support researchers and research students at Lancaster who require high performance and high throughput computing. This includes computing workloads with requirements that can't be met by the Interactive Unix Service (IUS) or desktop PCs.

The service combines what was the previously separately supported services for local high performance computing (HPC) users and the local Particle Physics research group (GridPP). The combined facility offers 13,000 cores, 59TB of aggregate memory, 24 Tesla V100 GPUs, 230TB of high performance filestore for general use and 4PB of medium performance filestore for GridPP data.  

The cluster operating system is Rocky Linux, with job submission handled by ithe SLURM Workload Manager. The service supports a wide variety of third-party software including numerical packages, libraries and C and Fortran compilers.
